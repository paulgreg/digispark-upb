# Digispark-usb

That program should be flashed on a digispark.

It uses [UniquePasswordBuilder](https://paulgreg.me/UniquePasswordBuilder/#pwa), which Firefox extension should be installed on your browser.

Project is described here : https://hackaday.io/project/167041-grandma-password-manager-helper
When tapping the button, UniquePasswordBuilder is opened by shortcut, then master password is entered, validated and computed password is pasted on current field.

It helps using a password manager.

Beware : while it helps to use a unique and strong password for each site, that tool make it very easy to steal your master password.
